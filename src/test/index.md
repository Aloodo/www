This page will help you find out if your browser
is vulnerable to some common forms of third-party
tracking.

Companies that track you from site to site can spread
fraud and malware on the web.  When you use [tracking
protection](/protection), you also help protect your
favorite sites.

(Your ad blocker may not provide tracking
protection.  Some blockers have [deceptive
settings](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/adblock-plus-dark-pattern/)
to trick users into participating in a <q>paid
whitelisting</q> scheme.  This test will help you
check if you are protected, and if not, to add the
protection you need.)

Click <q>Run test</q> below to start the test.
