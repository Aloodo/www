While web advertising offers easily trackable solutions for sales activation,
it has so far been unsuitable for the brand-building side, which, according to 

FIXME: E-B link

should represent a majority of ad spend.

This is because, for most users, the web functions
as a targetable, direct response medium, like direct
mail, and cannot carry the economic signal carried
by an obviously costly ad buy.

In addition, the data leakage that comes with web
tracking practices are responsible for short-term
problems such as brand-unsafe placements, ad fraud,
attribution fraud, and a high "adtech tax" that
limits the amount of an ad buy that actually reaches
working media.

Some large agencies and major brands are already
calling for systemic reform.  An industry-wide
solution might be a promising topic for
meetings, but for a subset of brands, web
advertising is not a problem where "the industry"
needs to "work together".  Mark Glaser, on the
DCN site, [does an excellent job of identifying the
problems](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2017/02/23/need-solve-digital-advertisings-quality-control-problem-now/).
But he writes,

> If the demand for money and efficiency is eroding the integrity of content—not to mention that of brands and platforms—everyone involved must collaborate to gain that trust back.

In the IT business, this kind of call for coordinated
action is what executives from legacy
companies say while they're getting ready for an
expensive conference with a golf tournament. And they
say it right about the time that an independent programmer
in a basement somewhere is writing the code to eat
their lunch.  When a whole industry is wrong about
something, that doesn't mean you have a big boring
assignment to persuade everyone in the industry. It means you have
an opportunity to make mad cash by being right.

Protected audience web advertising can have several
technical qualities to increase effectiveness, in
addition to limited third-party tracking:

 * Lower script performance impact, allowing for...
 
 * Larger, higher impact ad units, more creative scope
   and quality standards, allowing for...

 * Research-based reinsertion to avoid ad blockers

In this article we will describe the qualities of
a brand that we believe can be a successful early
adopter of protected audience web advertising.


## Does the brand have brand equity or a commitment to building it?

The brand should be committed to
building positive reputation and brand equity.
Low-reputation and high-reputation brands [need
fundamentally different qualities from an advertising
medium](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/tv-shopping-with-rory-sutherland/).

 * Low-reputation brands need to send ads only to
   people likely to respond, and pay extra to avoid
   people with expertise or authority to block others
   from responding to a deceptive offer.

 * High-reputation brands need to send a costly,
   hard-to-repudiate signal to an large audience.

When an ad medium is targetable, sellers lose the
ability to signal.  When an ad _could_ have been
targeted to a small group, you can see that the
advertiser isn't spending as much to reach you.

[Bob Hoffman
explains](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2017/02/why-tiffany-doesnt-make-infomercials.html).

> Most people are pretty good behavioral economists. They may not know anything about how the products they buy work, but they know how to read the advertising signals.

A low-quality or deceptive brand is better off with
today's conventional, targeted web advertising.

However, the more that a user gets protected from
tracking and targeting, the more signalful the
web becomes as an ad medium from that user's point
of view.


## Does the brand have noisy, low-reputation competitors?

Some high-reputation categories are great fits for
tracking protection because there are so many rip-offs
using targeted web ads.

 * Insurance 
 
 * Financial services

 * Health care

This is also a relatively easy win to measure: is the
customer retention rate higher when the customer is
protected from third-party tracking? If this is the
case, it makes a strong argument for incentivizing
customer protection.


## Does the brand depend on impressions formed over long-term use?

Look for goods that are difficult to evaluate at point
of purchase and where an experience with a deceptive
seller can be costly.

High-signal advertising is a way to take a position on
future customer satisfaction and what kind of word of
mouth that the brand is betting it will earn.

 * Tools

 * Vehicles


## Are first-party communications channels working well, with consent?

This is an easy one. If you already have the customers
reliably opening your email, or participating in
some other medium such as a customer web board,
you've got great data and nothing to lose by helping
to deny their info to the competition.  Play defense.


## Does the brand already have a tracking-protected customer base?

Some product categories already appeal to Internet
"privacy nerds" who are hard to reach by conventional
web ads.  Worse, conventional marketing tech is giving
you really bad numbers when enough of the customer
base is "invisible".  Tracking protection strategy
is essential here, just to keep from getting wrong
answers.  Don't do a big new product launch based on
what bots want.


## Next steps

The first step is to collect some data on tracking
protection adoption among the brand's customers
and prospects.  A high-traffic support or service
page is a good place to install [tracking protection
measurement](http://blog.aloodo.org/misc/howto/) to
get a baseline measurement on how well-protected the
audience is.  From there, it's a creative marketing
project to customize a tracking protection plan.
Tracking protection plans can leverage browser
privacy improvements, because browsers are making
it harder to track users from site to site without
their permission.  Along with privacy regulations,
this change is creating an opportunity for protected
audience web advertising that:

 * works with user privacy principles

 * has fewer of the negative externalities of targeted ads

 * [has immediate effects on current problems such as adfraud](https://blog.zgp.org/browser-privacy-improvements-and-anti-fraud/)

 * gives more market power and revenue to sites that users choose to trust

Most of this can be provided by third parties that
publishers are already using.  For example, Google
Tag Manager already has the required functionality in
order to comply with the European GDPR.
