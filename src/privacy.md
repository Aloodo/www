Aloodo.org websites (collectively “aloodo.org”
in this document) refer to sites hosted on the
aloodo.org, aloodo.com, aloodo.click, aloodo.link,
aloodo.net, and other related domains and subdomains
thereof.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Aloodo.org collects
non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make
available, such as the browser type, language
preference, referring site, and the date and time
of each visitor request. Aloodo.org’s purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information
is to better understand how Aloodo.org’s visitors
use its website. From time to time, Aloodo.org may
release non-personally-identifying information in the
aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
the usage of its website.

Aloodo.org also collects potentially
personally-identifying information like Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses. Aloodo.org does not
use such information to identify its visitors,
however, and does not disclose such information,
other than under the same circumstances that it uses
and discloses personally-identifying information,
as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Aloodo.org choose to interact with
Aloodo.org in ways that require Aloodo.org to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and
type of information that Aloodo.org gathers depends
on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username
and email address. In each case, Aloodo.org collects
such information only insofar as is necessary or
appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s
interaction with Aloodo.org. Aloodo.org does not
disclose personally-identifying information other
than as described below. And visitors can always
refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
with the caveat that it may prevent them from
engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics

Aloodo.org may collect statistics about the behavior
of visitors to its websites. For instance, Aloodo.org
may reveal how many visitors are protected from certain
forms of tracking protection.  However, Aloodo.org does not
disclose personally-identifying information other
than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Aloodo.org discloses potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information only to those of its employees,
contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i)
need to know that information in order to process
it on Aloodo.org’s behalf or to provide services
available at Aloodo.org, and (ii) that have agreed not
to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations may be
located outside of your home country; by using
Aloodo.org, you consent to the transfer of such
information to them. Aloodo.org will not rent
or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other
than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated
organizations, as described above, Aloodo.org
discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only when required
to do so by law, or when Aloodo.org believes in
good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary
to protect the property or rights of Aloodo.org,
third parties, or the public at large. If you
are a registered user of a Aloodo.org website and
have supplied your email address, Aloodo.org may
occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up
to date with what’s going on with Aloodo.org and our
products. We primarily use our blog to communicate
this type of information, so we expect to keep this
type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request
(for example via a support email or via one of our
feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish
it in order to help us clarify or respond to your
request or to help us support other users. Aloodo.org
takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
against the unauthorized access, use, alteration,
or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website
stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the
visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
the visitor returns. Aloodo.org uses cookies to help
Aloodo.org identify and track visitors, their usage
of Aloodo.org, and whether or not they are vulnerable
to certain forms of third-party tracking.  Aloodo.org
visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
their computers should set their browsers to refuse
cookies before using Aloodo.org’s websites, with
the drawback that certain features of Aloodo.org’s
websites may not function properly without the aid
of cookies.


## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor,
Aloodo.org may change its Privacy Policy
from time to time, and in Aloodo.org’s sole
discretion. Aloodo.org encourages visitors to
frequently check this page for any changes to its
Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after
any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute
your acceptance of such change.
