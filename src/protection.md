When you protect yourself from third-party tracking, you're helping to:

 * Protect yourself from malware that spreads through ad networks

 * Protect your favorite web sites from data leakage and advertising fraud.

 * Protect brands from inadvertently supporting terrorism, child pornography, and other illegal sites
   through <q>programmatic</q> advertising.

You can help advertisers spend less on the annoying
ads that <q>follow</q> you around the web, and more
on helping to pay for the web sites you use.

Tracking Protection is built into Firefox, but you need to change a setting in Preferences 
to turn it on.

<section id="privacybadger"><h2>Privacy Badger</h2>

[Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger),
a project of the non-profit [Electronic Frontier
Foundation](https://www.eff.org/), is a tracking
protection extension for Firefox and Google Chrome.
Privacy Badger only blocks trackers that it detects
following you across multiple sites, so you will
probably see a few ads <q>following</q> you until your
Privacy badger is trained.

<section id="msie"><h2>Microsoft Internet Explorer</h2>

<p>Tracking Protection is built in to Microsoft Internet
Explorer, but you need to subscribe to a Tracking
Protection List to protect yourself.</p>

<p><a class="buttonlink"
href="javascript:window.external.msAddTrackingProtectionList('http://easylist-msie.adblockplus.org/easyprivacy.tpl',
'EasyPrivacy Tracking Protection List')">Subscribe
to the EasyPrivacy Tracking Protection List</a>.</p>

<p>You can manage your tracking protection lists from
the <q>Safety</q> item in the gear menu at the upper
right of your browser window.</p>

## Note for ad blocker users 

Most ad blockers&mdash;even the ones that make misleading privacy claims&mdash;do **not** provide tracking protection by default.  For example, [Adblock Plus actually collects money from tracking companies to allow tracking, even when the user has turned on a privacy feature](http://blog.aloodo.org/posts/consumer-privacy-tool-not-so-much/).

You will need to install a tracking protection tool
as well.  All of the recommended options on this page
can be installed without removing your ad blocker.
